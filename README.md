In this project, I applied and analysed varies traditional machine learning algorithms on a real-world problem: "Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification Challenge". The Kaggle competition can be found using the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/overview. 

Key algorithms:

- [x] Naive Bayes
- [x] Logistic Regression
- [x] Decision Tree
- [x] Random Forest
- [x] Boosting
- [x] Ensemble Learning
- [x] Neural Network
